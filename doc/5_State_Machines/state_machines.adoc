== Introduction

In this lesson we are going to start to write more complex embedded programs.
To help accomplish this we are going to cover a powerful design pattern used in many embedded systems: State machines.

=== What is a State Machine

A state machine is a way of organizing an event driven system.
In a state machine we define the system states and how the system transitions between those states.

We often use State transition diagrams to show the states and the transitions between them.
For example the diagram below shows an example state machine for a traffic light with the criteria for each transition next to the transition arrow.

=== C Language Features

The following C language features will be needed for working with state machines in Zephyr

==== Function pointers

Before we discuss zephyr's state machine API we need to cover a core concept of the C language that is not covered in the intro to C courses.

When a program is executing the CPU runs through the following 3 stages

1. Fetch the next instruction from the system memory
2. Decode the instruction
3. Execute the instruction

During the fetch stage the CPU uses a special register called the Program Counter (PC) which stores the address of the next instruction to be fetched.
When a function is called the address the Program Counter holds is updated to the address of the first instruction of the function.
Effectively all a function is is a pointer to the location in memory where the first instruction is.

As a function is just a pointer we can store the corresponding address in a pointer variable and use it to call functions dynamically.
The following listing declares `function_pointer` as a pointer to the function `f` and calls the function via the pointer
[source,c]
----
void f(int);

void (*function_pointer)(int) = f;
function_pointer(10);
----

You can also use `typedef` to declare a function pointer type
[source,c]
----
typedef void (*func_p_t)(int); // func_p_t is a pointer to a function returning void and taking int as an arg

void f(int);
func_p_t func_p = f;
----

We can use function pointers to dynamically call functions or pass functions as arguments to other methods.
Function pointers that are passed into other APIs are often referred to as callbacks.
[source,c]
----
typedef void (*func_p_t)(int);

void f(int);
void g(int);

static const func_p_t my_func_array[] = {f, g};

// Example of using function pointers to dynamically call functions
for (int i=0; i < 2; i++)
{
    my_func_array[i](i); // Calls f(0) when i==0 and g(1) when i==1
}

// Function using a function pointer as a callback
void foo(func_p_t callback)
{
    callback(100);
}
----

The zephyr state machine API makes heavy use of function pointers.

==== Static variables and functions

Static variables and functions are heavily used in embedded systems.
Static variables appear in 2 contexts, as variables within a function and as local variables within a file.

In a function static variables maintain their value between function calls to the function
[source, c]
----
int increment_return(void) {
    static int x = 0;

    return x++; // The return of increment_return will be incremented by 1 each call.
                // If x was not declared static then increment_return would always return 0
}
----

Static variables that are declared at file scope are only accessible within the file (also referred to as the translation unit) the variable is declared in.
Similarly to static variables defined functions that are defined static are only available within the translation unit they are defined in.
In general static function prototypes should be defined at the top of the corresponding source file rather than in a header file.

==== Enum data types

Enumerated types or enums are a user defined type that allow the developer to define and group integer constants.
The listing below shows an example of a enum defined for colours.
[source, c]
----
typedef enum colour {
    RED,
    GREEN,
    BLUE
} colour_t;

colour_t colour = RED;
----

Enums are often used to define integer constants that are related to each other.
We will use enums to define the different states of state machines.

=== Zephyr State Machine API

Zephyr provides a framework for creating state machines called the state machine framework.
The documentation for the state machine framework is available at: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/smf/index.html

== Lesson

. First we want to get git to a clean branch off of the tip of main.
Run `git fetch upstream main` to fetch the latest changes from the upstream branch
. Then run `git checkout main` to checkout your local copy of the main branch. If this step fails you likely have files from lesson 4 that are not commited. Commit those files to the lesson 4 branch before continuing
. Next run `git pull upstream main` to get your main branch synced with the upstream branch.
. At this point you can check you are in the correct spot either using a tool like the vs code Git Graph extension, gitk or by running the command `git log -1 --oneline` which will tell you that you are on the branch main and are also at the tip of upstream/main. Optionally at this point you can run `git push origin main` to syncronize the updates with your fork.
. At this point you can create a new branch for lesson 5 by running `git checkout -b lesson-5`

=== Create a simple state machine

To start with we are going to create a simple state machine that blinks an LED.

. The first step in creating a state machine is to define all the states and draw out the state diagram.
The state diagram is drawn below
+

This is a rather simple state machine with only 2 states, however as you start to work with more complicated machines this process becomes invaluable.
. Next we need to enable the state machine framework in kconfig. Similarly to when we enabled the GPIO in lesson 3 we need to enable the state machine framework by adding the `CONFIG_SMF` to the `prj.conf` file in `app`. The `prj.conf` should look like the below afterwards.
+
image::prj_edits.png[]
. To organize our code better we are going to split the state machine into a separate C and H file. In the app/src folder create the files `my_state_machine.c` and `my_state_machine.h`. Similarly to when we initially created the main.c file we need to add the new source file to the `app/CMakeLists.txt` file. After adding the new source file the `CMakeLists.txt` file should have the following
+
image::cmake_edits.png[]
NOTE: As we have modified the cmake source files you may need to do a clean build which you can either do by deleting the `build` folder or adding the `-p always` option when you run `west build`
. At this point you should stage your changes in git and commit
. Now we will create 2 function prototypes in the header file we made.
+
image::header_file.png[]
. Next we want to include the header file in the `main.c` file and call the init and run methods defined in the header.
+
image::main_c.png[]
At this point the rest of the source code will be written within the new my_state_machine.c file
. To start with in the my_state_machine.c file we will include the `zephyr/smf.h`, `LED.h`, and `my_state_machine.h` files and create the functions from the header which will be left blank for now.
+
image::initial_src.png[]
. At this point we need to create our states.
Zephyr uses two data structures to define the states.
The first is an enum with each of the states mapped to a value in the enum.
Each state should be given a unique name that is descriptive of what the state is doing.
+
The second structure is an array that defines the following functions for each state within the `smf_state` struct

* entry: The entry function is called whenever the corresponding state is entered.
* run: The corresponding states run function is called every time the state machine is updated.
* exit: The exit function is called whenever the corresponding state is exited.

+
Zephyr provides the `SMF_CREATE_STATE` macro to easily fill our the `smf_state struct`.
If there is no action to be preformed on entry or exit they can be defined as NULL.
The SMF_CREATE_STATE macro also takes two additional arguments for creating hierarchical state machines, but those are beyond the scope of this course and can be left as null.
For the LED blink state machine we are making the enum and states array are defined below.
In this case we will not need exit functions so they are left null.

+
image::states_created.png[]
. Zephyr uses a struct we define to keep track of the state of the state machine.
We can also use this struct to define and keep track of variables needed by the state machine.
For the LED state machine we will add a counter to this struct to keep track of when we need to change states.
+
image::state_object_creation.png[]
. At this point we have enough that we can fill out the init and run function we made earlier but left empty.
In the init function we will use the zephyr `smf_set_initial` to set the initial state of the state machine and in the run function we will use the zephyr `smf_run_state` to call the run function of the current state.
For the LED state machine these functions are defined below
+
image::init_and_run_definition.png[]
. Finally we can define the rest of the functions for our states.
In the state entry functions we will set the LED either on or off corresponding to the on and off state respectively.
In the state run function we will update the counter defined in the state machine structure and if the counter is above 500 change to the next state.
To change states we will use the zephyr `smf_set_state` function.
The run function must return the `smf_state_result` enum which for non hierarchical state machines should always return `SMF_EVENT_HANDLED`.
The complete definitions for our state machine are given below
+
image::state_function_definitions.png[]
At this point you should be able to build and flash the board and see the LED blink at about 1 Hz.
If you haven't already done so commit your changes to the lesson 5 branch


== Exercise

Complete the following exercises. Make sure to use git to track your changes.

. Modify the state machine we created to use an exit function for each state rather than an entry function.
. Create a state machine for the following state diagram
+

For each state also print upon entering and exiting the state to the console
* Rewrite the password lock exercise from lesson 4 using a state machine.
